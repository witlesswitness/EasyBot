	design the pieces (how will server work, UI from attacker)
	
		Service hosts a webpage that the bots periodically scan to receive commands associated with their ID
	
	look up beaconing, stealth, way to push out commands to clients, socket programming,
	higher level libraries that can accept connections or set up python server
	
	use kali2020 as server
	use small vms or metasploitable as infected machines.
